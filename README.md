churn-site
===

A app to calculate and display churn on a project.

This is a web front-end and hooks that trigger builds, but all the data is powered by the [churn gem](https://github.com/danmayer/churn)

## To Run Examples Locally

    foreman start
    #or
    bundle exec rackup -p 3000
    #or with dev procfile for shotgun reloading
    foreman start -f Procfile.dev -e prod.env
    #or local with production data (make sure red is and other env vars are set)
    RACK_ENV=production foreman start -f Procfile

## TODO

* setup heroku cron job to run rake tasks that calculates and caches avgs across all projects
* verify and test history is build in correct order (oldest first)
* automatically build out history on first add or web hook hit
* fix issues with class and method level churn
* clean up / refactoring
* test coverage
* travis-ci
* build a working heroku console that loads all the right classes
