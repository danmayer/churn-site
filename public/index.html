<h1>Churn Disabled</h1>

<p>This was a fun project and I learned a lot of about AWS, long
running tasks, and automated deployment, but the backend system to run
the EC2s has fallen apart, and I no longer have time to work on the
project. Also, it was starting to cost money to host on both Heroku
and AWS. So goodnight toy project, it was fun learning with you.</p>
